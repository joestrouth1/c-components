This old header will soon be removed and placed in a site project.

It's only being developed here for convenience.

Note to self: avoid hard-coding absolute positioning into components in order to
avoid this mess. Might revise the current copy-pasta solution to fix this.

```jsx
<HeaderLegacy />
```
